In this updated code, a new function copy_to_clipboard is added. It retrieves the shortened URL from the result label and uses the pyperclip library to copy it to the clipboard. The "Copy" button is initially disabled, and it becomes enabled when a URL is shortened.

Now, after shortening a URL, you can click the "Copy" button to copy the shortened URL to the clipboard.

Make sure to install the pyperclip library using pip: pip install pyperclip.

Feel free to customize the appearance and behavior of the UI to suit your needs.
